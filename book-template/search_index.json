Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. New changes coming soon! The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) "],["basics.html", "Chapter 2 Bookdown basics 2.1 Subsections 2.2 Cross-referencing 2.3 Code chunks 2.4 Figures and tables 2.5 Citations", " Chapter 2 Bookdown basics In development. 2.1 Subsections Subsections can be created using pound signs (#): # First-level header (only for the title) ## Second-level header ### Third-level header The default use of the headers will produce numbers. This can be disabled using {-}after the header, e.g., ## Learning objectives {-}. 2.2 Cross-referencing You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1 using \\@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2.5 using the name of the chapter: \\@(citations). 2.3 Code chunks R code can be embedded into the books like so: ```{r} library(datasets) cars[1:2,] ``` Which yields: library(datasets) cars[1:2,] ## speed dist ## 1 4 2 ## 2 4 10 2.3.1 Workshop script For participants who wish to have the code used during the workshop so that they can easily follow along, we will now automatically create a script using knitr::purl(). purl() will automatically extract the code from all the code chunks used in the book. If you consider that a particular code chunk should not be included in the final script, the purl=FALSE option can be used when creating the chunk. Note that purl=TRUE by default. For example, the following chunk would not be included in the script: ```{r purl=FALSE} library(datasets) cars[1:2,] ``` Given that purl() will also extract any comments in chunk, it is encourage to annotate the code in the chunks as much as possible so that the script will be detailed for anyone wishing to use it that was not able to attend the workshop. 2.4 Figures and tables Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1 using \\@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1 using \\@ref(tab:nice-tab). knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (???). See Chapter 2.5 for more information on how to make citations.

Each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. The name of the Rmd files should follow this structure: XX-chapter_name.Rmd with XXbeing the number of the chapter. 3.2 The index.Rmd file In addition to the chapters, each book contains an index.Rmd file which will automatically be the first chapter of all books and which should contain links to the GitHub page and presentation for its respective workshop. Notice that this file has no number on its file name. When building the book, bookdown automatically uses the index.Rmdfile as the first chapter and then follows the numbering of the other files. Take this into account when naming your chapters as your 01-chapter_name.Rmd will actually be the second chapter and so on. 3.3 Additional Resources chapter The books should also contain a final chapter called XX-references.Rmd which will contain any citations that you used and can also contain any additional material and resources if participants wish to obtain more information on the subject. Please refer to Chapter 2.5 for more information on how create the content of this chapter. Example For example, the English version of the wiki for Workshop 1 has 8 sections. So the book would have a total of 10 Rmd files which include the index.Rmd file, 8 XX-chapter_name.Rmd files numbered 01 - 08, and the final 9-references.Rmdfile. "],["citations-1.html", "Chapter 4 Citations 4.1 The BibTeX format 4.2 Creating a BibTeX database 4.3 Adding the BibTeX database 4.4 The XX-references.Rmd file", " Chapter 4 Citations In development. We already covered the basics on how to insert an inline citation on Chapter 2. However, those examples only work for this book because they are the packages we are using to create the book. If we wanted to cite another package or a book/article/etc., we first have to create the bibliography entries of those packages, books, articles, etc. 4.1 The BibTeX format Bookdown uses pandoc-citeproc for its html output. Many bibliography formats can be used by pandoc-citeproc, but BibTex is quite simple and relatively standard so we will use it for our books. Here is a basic example of a BibTex entry: @Book{abramowitz+stegun, author = &quot;Milton {Abramowitz} and Irene A. {Stegun}&quot;, title = &quot;Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables&quot;, publisher = &quot;Dover&quot;, year = 1964, address = &quot;New York City&quot;, edition = &quot;ninth Dover printing, tenth GPO printing&quot; } Now let’s see what the structure of the entry is: Each entry starts with a type (e.g. @Book{) such as article or book, among others. It is then followed by a citation-key (e.g. abramowitz+stegun,) which can be used to produce the inline citations. So if we wanted to cite our example book we would use @abramowitz+stegun to produce this citation: Abramowitz and Stegun (1964). Finally, the entry has multiple tags which give the characteristics of the entry (e.g. author, title, year, etc.) There are some required tags for each type of entry as well as some optional ones. You can find a list of the different types and the required and optional tags for each type here. 4.2 Creating a BibTeX database Now that we know the basics about BibTeX, we can apply it. For this, we have to create a BibTeX database which is a plain-text file with a .bib extension. For example, we created an example.bibfile so that we could use the Abramowitz and Stegun (1964) citation. The file name for the database of each workshop should be workshop-X-citations.bib. 4.2.1 R packages If you wish to cite any R packages, knitr contains the helper function write_bib() that automatically produces the BibTeX entries for the selected packages and creates a datbase for the packages. Here is an example that this template uses to produce citations such as this one for bookdown (Xie 2020): knitr::write_bib(c( .packages(), &#39;bookdown&#39;, &#39;knitr&#39;, &#39;rmarkdown&#39; ), &#39;packages.bib&#39;) 4.3 Adding the BibTeX database To include the database in the book, you must: Save the .bib file in the book-en or book-fr folder. Add the file name to the bibliography field in the YAML metadata section of the index.Rmd file. Multiple database files can be included. For example, the bibliography field of this template looks like this: bibliography: [packages.bib, example.bib] 4.4 The XX-references.Rmd file The basic format of this Rmd file should only contain the following expression: `r if (knitr::is_html_output()) &#39;# Additional resources {-}&#39;` ### References {-} This will output only the references we included in the main BibTeX database (i.e. the workshop-X-citations.bib file) and any packages we cited inside the book. Note that this will not include the rest of the package reference entries created by knitr if they were not cited inside the book. 4.4.1 Including other resources Most of the wikis for the QCBS R Workshop Series contain a section at the end where we offer additional resources for the participants interested in more information about the subject of the workshop. To include these into this last chapter of the book, you can add a new subsection after the basic expression showed above. In this book, we have included a link to the bookdown manual as an additional resource like this: `r if (knitr::is_html_output()) &#39; # Additional resources {-} &#39;` For more information on how to use bookdown, you can check the bookdown manual [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). ### References {-} References "],["additional-resources.html", "Additional resources", " Additional resources For more information on using bookdown, you can check the bookdown manual here.
